### Caixin Scraper

**Description:**
This web scraper was written to assist a research project at Harvard's Belfer Center seeking to identify 
cases of corruption in China that appear in the media before being officially announced by the 
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (typically, it is the other way around in China).
