### Executive Summary

**Background & Motivation:** 

Residents of Kanifing Municipality in The Gambia face a serious issue: their neighborhoods are filled with openly dumped trash. Much of the waste produced by households, businesses, and pedestrians ends up on the ground in communities instead of properly disposed of at the municipal dumpsite. This is especially true in areas with limited access to municipal waste management services. In Ebo Town and Tallinding, for example, some unregulated dumpsites have grown to cover hundreds of thousands of square feet. There is significant concern among citizens and elected officials about the consequences of these open dumps – trash left to sit in communities threatens the health and safety of residents and pollutes the environment.


**Problem Statement:** 

Under Mayor Talib Ahmed Bensouda, Kanifing Municipal Council (KMC) has made it its number one priority to clean trash from public spaces and improve waste management. This is no easy task, especially because KMC’s budgetary and infrastructural constraints limit its operational capacity. Achieving better results requires getting more with less and precision-targeting interventions to areas of need. That is why this project focuses on improving KMC’s operational efficiency in cleaning openly dumped trash from communities.


**Project Scope:** 

We aim to develop a scalable, repeatable, ethical, and cost-effective way to find, map, and measure unregulated dumpsites so KMC can clean public spaces with precision & economy.


**Methodology:** 

First, we conduct aerial surveys of Kanifing neighborhoods using a camera drone. Next, we train a neural network to identify trash in aerial photos and apply it to our drone images. We call this computer vision model TrashBot. Finally, we stitch together images that have been run through TrashBot to create interactive maps that highlight openly dumped trash, allowing KMC to find, map, and measure unregulated dumpsites.

**Results & Deliverables:** 

As a proof of concept, we surveyed over 600 acres in 5 Kanifing neighborhoods, where we located nearly 400,000 square feet of trash. We provide KMC with seven TrashBot maps and a suite of custom software tools so they can run the methodology independently.

**Recommendations:** 

Due to privacy implications inherent to the use of drones and machine learning, we set technical & operational standards for the ethical use of our methodology. These include image obfuscation, data security measures, purpose limitation, and democratic controls.
Finally, we develop six use cases for KMC to apply our methods to its most pressing waste management issues. These include:
1. Intervention targeting
2. Optimizing receptacle placement
3. Waste management metric tracking
4. Finding and closing unregulated dumpsites 5. Modeling health and environmental risk
6. Expanding service range strategically
