### COVID Visualizations

**Description:**
These data visualizations were created for the City of Seattle's vaccine distribution task force with the goal of 
making it easy to visualize the following insights in one simple view:

1. What is the current state of COVID cases and deaths in Seattle and other cities?
2. How does the current state of the pandemic compare to recent months?
3. How does the current state of the pandemic compare to all prior months?
